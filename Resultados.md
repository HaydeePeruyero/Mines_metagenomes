# Tree with 72 sequences given by Cesar and 14 GR_S381 + 17 Pmt2_S287 + 15 S1_S286

We observe 9 sequence from the SR and GR metagenomes closest to the sequences of the known fluorinase and the sequence with the fluorinase box. 

Note: without shaving

## Subtree

We extrat the subtree where we found some sequences closest to the known fluorinase and the sequences with the fluorinase box. Then we shaved the subtree eliminating the poorly aligned sequences and we find one sequence [NHPAHDLJ_60062] from the GR metagenome in the same branch of the subtree. Using blastp we found a sequence with 94% of coverage and 85.93% of identity, the accesion id of this sequence is WP_135282290.1 and is a cysteine desulfurase.
